Marketplace APp


Requires node.js and expo to run. Planning to continue building on expo before ejecting to a native build. 

Setting up expo on IOS:

https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup  
(I recommended using brew to install node.js instead. Solved a lot of the issues I had in the beginning)

Then download Expo Go on your phone. 

Start server and scan barcode with phone. 

If there's any issues, let me know.
